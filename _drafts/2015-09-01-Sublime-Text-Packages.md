Every developer has their own set of tools to implement their solutions to various projects. One of the most essential tool is the program where to write beautiful code. Programming languages play a major part in choosing the right one for the job.

I've tried several code editors from IDEs ([WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/), [phpDesigner](http://www.mpsoftware.dk/phpdesigner.php)) to simple text editors ([Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/))
