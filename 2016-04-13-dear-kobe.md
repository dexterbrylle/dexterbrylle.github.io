# Death, taxes, and Kobe Fadeaways

Dear Kobe,

I was raised in a basketball household. My middle name is Jordan, and as you would expect everyone in our household was an MJ fan. No way in this earth that we are related, but carrying that name comes with pride. His Airness, the GOAT, there's nothing left to be said. I am proud of having that name but since I was a kid, I knew I was different. I didn't gravitate towards #23 as much as my relatives did. Maybe I was too young to really understand the gravity of our name and the global player known for it, nevertheless I was proud to be a Jordan.

I was probably seven or eight, it was early morning, I woke up and turned on the TV. We didn't have cable back then, but for some reason our TV picked up a channel's signal that was showing the NBA. All throughout the broadcast, the commentators were enamoured by a kid named Kobe. So I watched closely and tried to follow the player that they were gushing over. I saw a skinny dude with puffy hair, he got the ball. Dribbled right, I saw him lean back as if he was almost lying down, shot the ball. Swish. I was astonished and amazed.

I found my favourite basketball player.

I too was enamoured by your basketball antics. Most people would be excited about your highlight dunks. Me? I was more into the beauty of your footwork and the grace of your fadeaways. Anything else, they're just gravy to the way you play basketball. Honestly, if I was trapped in a maze and the only way to get out is to answer questions about you, I'd probably be out of there faster than your rap career. Proof? I know that you speak three languages (English, Spanish, Italian). I know you took Brandy to prom. I also know why you chose number 8 when you first got into the league. I know that you're as savvy in your English class as you are dribbling the basketball. And your parents must be foodies as they named you after a steak. Ask me how many times you've been selected to  the All-NBA, All-NBA Defensive, All-Star teams. Ask me the years you sat out the All-Star games because of injuries. Ask me how many times you scored 50+ points in consecutively. I can answer it before you even finish the question. It may seem obsessive, but hey, I got it from you. I am your biggest fan this side of the globe.

# Everything negative – pressure, challenges – is all an opportunity for me to rise.

Over the years, I studied and was engulfed by your persona. You were called an enigma. The most polarizing figure in basketball, probably in all of sports. Your persona was such a mystery that many found it hard to like you. Arrogant. Over-confident. Alienating. That made me curious as to who you really are.  I watched your games religiously and would be disheartened every time you lose. I listened to every interview you made, whether it's basketball or something else. I'm an outsider looking in, but what your detractors don't understand is that your influence goes beyond the hardwood, the arena, and the bright lights of Los Angeles. It transcends gender, geography, and race.

Look, I'm just a regular guy trying to help change the world, one line of code at a time. We may have contrasting professional lives, but you'd be surprised how I used you as the blueprint on how to become a better version of me. Come to think of it, we share a few attributes that made me relate to you. I tend to isolate people when I'm busy working on my craft. I'm arrogant because I can't force myself to pay attention to someone who can't and won't bring out the best in me, or even interest my wandering mind. I absolutely despise small talks, it's business or nothing at all. I may not be on your level of work ethic, yet, but I am like you, relentless. And that's what I love most about you,  your drive and that commitment to make things happen. You don't give a fck what other people think about you and your pursuit to greatness. And come to think of it, on most days I find myself taking in your persona. My friends, colleagues, and even people around me would laugh or make snarky remarks at my crazy Kobe obsession, and I couldn't care less because I know, I get you Kobe.

# I am chasing perfection

As I'm watching you play your last game right now, all those years of hard work and sacrifice, no matter how much your body breaks down your dedication to give it 100% every night is beyond admirable and inspiring.
