> Farewell!

Saying goodbye is one of the most difficult gestures to do. It is even harder when that goodbye is to someone you're close to. But it's hardest when it's bidding farewell to a group of people that you've grown close to and admired. 

Two years ago, I did not know what to expect. I was expecting to just go about the job description that I agreed to. (I fell asleep on my first day! I snored. Sorry _Erico_! lol). I'm not an extrovert. I like to observe and share my opinion only when it's asked. Here's what I gathered from my observations: the hunger to succeed and make a difference is what makes them push through any task they have. It doesn't matter if working overnight as long it gets the job done. I love that and that's something I can relate to.

> Thank you!

So fast forward to today. After __countless sleepovers__, __loud Wunderbars__, and __fun Wunderweekends__, my deepest gratitude to everyone who made my stay here a memorable one. 

## THANK YOU _Clave_, _Miss Chay_, and _EJ_ for giving me the opportunities to grow and succeed!

## THANK YOU WUNDERFRIENDS FOR TWO YEARS OF FULL OF ADVENTURES, LAUGHTER, AND AWESOMENESS!
