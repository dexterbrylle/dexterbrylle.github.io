I am a developer that loves my coffee (especially in the morning). I have a great curiosity on how things work and a keen interest in learning new stuff on a wide variety of topics (such as aviation, space, network architecture, etc.). On my free time __and__ before I start to code, I usually hangout at [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/), [HackerNews](http://news.ycombinator.com), or at [Silver Screen & Roll](http://silverscreenandroll.com). I wish my activity graph in [Github](http://github.com/dexterbrylle) is as busy as my [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/dexterbrylle) account. If you know me personally, please don't be offended if you think I'm ignoring you. My mind is just synchronously spawning and wandering through thought branches with an impassive stare at a blank space (or you).

If you would like to connect with me professionally you can shoot me an [email](mailto:dexterbrylle@gmail.com) or tweet me anything at [@DexterBrylle](http://twitter.com/dexterbrylle).

Opinions are my own. Code snippets are open source.
