I am a developer that loves my coffee (especially in the morning). I have a great curiosity on how things work and a keen interest in learning new, different stuff on a wide variety of topics (such as aviation, space, hoops, etc.). On my free time __and__ before I start to code, I usually hangout at [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/), [HackerNews](http://news.ycombinator.com), or at [Silver Screen & Roll](http://silverscreenandroll.com). I wish my activity stats in [Github](http://github.com/dexterbrylle) is as colorful as my [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/dexterbrylle) account. If you know me personally, please don't be offended if you think I'm ignoring you. My mind is just synchronously wandering through and spawning thought branches while staring blankily at a blank space (or you).

If you would like to connect with me professionally you can shoot me an [email](mailto:dexterbrylle@gmail.com) or tweet me at [@DexterBrylle](http://twitter.com/dexterbrylle).
